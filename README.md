# fanmod-cmd
fork of the fanmod tool that supports commandline execution

# status
the options are still very limited, but can be easily extended s.t. all
options from the gui are available.

# build & run
* Ensure the wxWidgets Cross-platform C++ GUI toolkit is installed
(e.g. package libwxgtk3.0-dev under Debian or module wxWidgets/3.0.2)
* build with './makefiles/make.sh.linux'
* the macos version is not supported!

run './fanmod-cmd --help' to see all available options

# credit
the original algorithm was developed by S. Wernicke and F. Rasche and
